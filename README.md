# flightgear

A flightgear library for the London Clojure Dojo.

## Usage

# FlightGear

1) Download FlightGear for your platform from http://www.flightgear.org/download/

2) Run with the command line parameter "--telnet=5401"

# Leinigen

Add "[org.clojars.dalethatcher/flightgear "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]" to your project.clj.

## API

# Quick Start

```clojure
> (use 'flightgear.api)
> (connect "localhost" 5401)
> (starter! true) ; wait until engine started
> (starter! false)
> (flaps! 0.5)
> (throttle! 1)  ; wait for a little while and you should be airbourne
> (rudder! 0.1) ; steer a bit to the right (single props tend to veer to one side)

You'll briefly have the elation of flying, most likely followed by a nice crash.

# Telemetry

```clojure

# Controls

See http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/design/q0101.shtml for a description of aircraft control surfaces.

```clojure
(starter! true|false) - Turn the starter key, don't forget to turn off!
(throttle! 0..1) - Power to the engine.
(flaps! 0..1) - Sort of a fixed up and down mostly used for take off and landing.
(rudder! -1..1) - Steer left and right (yaw).
(elevator! -1..1) - Up and down (pitch).
(aileron! -1..1) - Left and right with rotate (roll).
